This sketch is an example sketch for a solar-powered cell-radio wireless stream sensing station based on those recently deployed at Delawareâ€™s First State National Historic Park (FSNHP), as described in our [EnviroDIY Mayfly logger stations deployed in PA, DE and MN!](http://envirodiy.org/envirodiy-mayfly-logger-stations-deployed-in-pa-de-and-mn/) blog post. For this deployment, the data are posted to a data system at [http://swrcsensors.dreamhosters.com](http://swrcsensors.dreamhosters.com), which can only be accessed by Stroud Center staff. 

**WARNING:** This sketch will not work in it's entirity as it is currently written, because the data are posted to a dummy RESTful endpoint URL 
(http://somewebsite.com/somescript.php?) using the syntax that is expected at by our system at http://swrcsensors.dreamhosters.com. However, this sketch could be modified to post sensor measurements from any sensor to any receiving data system that has been configured to accept them.
