Example Arduino Sketches for the Mayfly Board
==============

All of the Mayfly boards have been pre-programmed with a sample sketch.  When you first connect power to the board, you will see the red and green LEDs blinking.

If you connect the Mayfly to your computer, open the Arduino IDE and topen a serial terminal window at 57600 baud, you will see the current temperature as measured by the DS3231â€™s internal temperature sensor, updated every second.
